     * Write a method findMin() with the array as a parameter. The method needs to return the minimum value in the array.
     * In the main() method read the count from the console and call the method readIntegers() with the count parameter.
     * Then call he findMin() method passing the array returned from the call to the readIntegers method.
     * Finally ,print the minimum element in the array.
